Please store your plugins inside this directory. The CorvusChat server will use this directory for the
default plugin directory if a plugin shall be loaded. Of course you can use sub directories.

Also it would be nice if your developed plugin has a ccsp_* file name prefix for a better overview.
Please use "_x64" file name postfix for 64 bit plugin builds and "_x86" file name postfix for 32 bit plugin builds.

Complete example:
	- 64 bit: ccsp_pluginfilename_x64.dll
	- 32 bit: ccsp_pluginfilename_x86.dll

Note that you have to put your plugin config files into the scripts directory (or any sub directory).
